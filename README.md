This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug caused by type coercion. The function `foo` takes two arguments and returns their sum. However, if one argument is a number and the other is a string, JavaScript will perform string concatenation instead of numerical addition. This behavior can lead to unexpected results and is a frequent source of errors in JavaScript programs. The solution demonstrates how to use type checking to avoid this type of error.
